  // var scoping refresher:
  // 3 ways to declare variables:
    //  1. var
    //  2. let
    //  3. const
  // Var:
    // we can update/reassign var variables.
    // how are var variables scoped!
    // Scoping mean where are these variables available to the developer.
    // var variables are function scoped which means they are only available inside
    // the function, or if they are not created inside the function at all (they are globally scoped)
    // they are available in the window.

    // var width = 100;
    // console.log(width);
    // width = 200;
    // console.log(width);

    // there is no error since the width is availabe inside of the function:
    function setWidth() {
      var width = 100;
      console.log(width);
    }
    setWidth();
    // if i add console.log(width) after I set the width will it work?
    // console.log(width);
    // No in the the console, I see an error: Uncaught ReferenceError: width is not defined.
    // Because width is only scoped to that function. It is a local variable to this function,
    // and it is not available outsid the function.

    // However this will work if you globally declare the variable outside the function and assign
    // to a number inside the function like so:
    // var width
    // function setWidth() {
    //   width = 100;
    //   console.log(width);
    // }
    // setWidth();
    // console.log(width);
    // but it is frowned upon to do this.

    // Another example:
    // var age = 100;
    // if(age > 12) {
    //   var dogYears = age * 7;
    //   console.log(`You are ${dogYears} dog years old.`)
    // }
    // it works but the one thing that you will notice: Since var variable are function scoped
    // there is no function in this example so it scoped the entire window (so when you type in
    // type dogYears in the console you will see 700).

    // Let and const are scoped to the block instead of the function.
    // Any time you see an open and closing curly bracket that is a block.

    var age = 100;
    if(age > 12) {
      let dogYears = age * 7;
      // got an error: VM25215:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: dogYears is not defined
      // because I declared it as a let variable and it is only declared inside a
      // a block scope not a function scope and that temporary variale has not leaked out
      // you will receive the same error if you add const as well.
      // let and const variables are block scoped
      console.log(`You are ${dogYears} dog years old.`)
    }
    let height = 200;
    const key = 'abc123';
